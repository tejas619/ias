	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Background and Motivation}
	In today’s world connected by the Internet, cyber security has become a major concern. In order
to be secure, software as well as hardware industries around the world are working proactively to
secure their software and stay secured. One of the major threats to these industries arises due to
malware which can be defined as a small piece of software that is intended to damage or disable
computers and computer systems. Hence our research survey is focused on studying techniques
to proactively detect and defend against these malwares.

Stuxnet[cite] considered to be the most sophisticated piece of Malware ever detected was used in operations against Iran in 2010. This Malware was so sophisticated and complicated that, it was believed that this can be developed and deployed only with fundings which can be compared nationwide. Stuxnet is unique in its own nature because unlike other Viruses or Worms it targets systems that are traditionally not connected to the internal network, which can also be termed as isolated machines. It infected Windows machines through USB keys and then propagated accross the network scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC (programmable logic controllers). This helped the Malware to use the information it gathered to take control of other systems, and making them behave to failure. In order to maintain its persistent it provided false feedback to the main controllers outside the network. All these efforts were taken to slow down Iranian Nuclear Program which was considered as a cyber war.

The above example inspires us about the need to be aware about cyber security and how it might affect our cyber world. Many organizations like Kaspersky labs, CorwdStrike are constantly developing expertise to detect these kind of Malwares and Trojans spreading around the world. Therefore, we find this topic Malware analysis for proactive detection and prevention very intriguing to study about.
	\subsection{Goals and scope}
	Our goal for this research survey is to explore and scrutinize various techniques to perform Malware Analysis and understand its application in the real world for proactive defense.
	The scope of our research survey encompasses the following areas:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Various methods to perform Malware Analysis}
		\item{Tools currently used to perform Malware Analysis} 
		\item{Techniques for proactive defense against Malware}
		\item{Techniques to prevent IT networks from Malwares}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Tasks Completed}
	This section talks about specific tasks completed by each group member till date.
		\subsection{Tejas Khairnar (1207690220, Group Leader)}
		I, as the group leader is organizing weekly meetings with the whole team. My duties include keeping a check on work done by every group member.
		I am also helping everyone with finding good papers in the area of malware analysis techniques. Apart from that I have also been reading the research paper "Toward automated dynamic malware analysis using cwsandbox". \\
		
		This paper talks about sanbox technique being used for dynamic malware analysis. When it comes to dynamic analysis, the authros are trying to execute the malware. this execution they are trying to do in a sandboxed environment. They further discuss various approaches they took in order to analyze the malware like, API hooking and DLL code injection. They have also built a CWSandboxed architecture in which they have described various phases to achieve malware analysis. The researchers further led their research into an open source tool called as "Cuckoo Sanbox: Automate Malware Analysis". Currently this is the best open source tool available in the security community.\\

		My team is working collectively towards understanding the various aspects of Malware Analysis. I have been assigned the task of researching the topic of Malware Reverse Engineering and gathering as much as literature on this topic as possible. I started by reading the paper "Helping Johnny to Analyze Malware - A usability-optimized decompiler and malware analysis user study" which talks about the current industry standards being used to decompile malware code and their shortcomings. \\
		The two major contribution made by this paper were:
		First, the authors provided several code transformation techniques which preserve the semantics of the malware code and improve code readability. The authors created DREAM++ an extension to the current state-of-the-art decompilers which simplifies expression and control flow transformations and also maintains the semantics of the variables and constants according to the context they were used in.
		Second, the authors conducted several studies to compare the three decompilers and note the improvements of the DREAM++ over the already existing decompilers.
		Tools covered in this paper: DREAM, Hex-rays, DREAM++\\
		
		My next steps involve diving deep on the topic of Malware reverse engineering by reading associated papers to this one. 
		The associated papers which I found useful and relevant to this one are:
		Decompilers and beyond Ilfak Guilfanov, Hex-Rays SA, 2008 
		K. Yakdan, S. Eschweiler, E. Gerhards-Padilla, and M. Smith. No More Gotos: Decompilation Using Pattern-Independent Control-Flow Structuring and Semantics-Preserving Transformations. In Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), 2015.
		Z. Lin, X. Zhang, and D. Xu. Automatic Reverse Engineering of Data Structures from Binary Execution. In Proceedings of the 17th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), 2010.
		
		\subsection{Aloma Lopes (1209273126)}
		I have been researching on processes to determine the behavior and purpose of any malware sample and thus went through the paper “Exploring Multiple Execution Paths for Malware Analysis”. Traditional Malware analysis tools observe the behavior of the sample only on a single program execution path, i.e, the reports generated by their analysis of the samples contains the interaction observed at in a given test environment and at a particular point in time. This does not give us a comprehensive overview of the actions that the sample can perform. The reason is that these malware programs contain certain checks for the execution of certain parts of their code and if these conditions are not met while it’s interaction in that execution trace in which it is analyzed, incorrect conclusions may be drawn as these conditional parts of the code have not been executed.\\
		According to the paper, the limitation of these traditional malware analysis tools can be overcome by increasing the test coverage and allow automated malware systems to explore multiple execution paths of a malware program, depending on how certain inputs are processed by the code. It tracks some interesting inputs that are read by the program and then identify decision points that use these inputs to decide the program flow. These decision points are then snapshot, so that we return to them to alter the inputs in such a way that it explores all possible branches. The experimental results performed on a set of 308 real-world malicious code samples demonstrate that these different malware samples exhibit different behavior based on the input read from the environment.\\
		
		To further understand existing systems that perform malware analysis, I will read the following papers and understand the procedure that they have followed to detect the behavior of malware samples:
		U. Bayer, C. Kruegel, and E. Kirda. TTAnalyze: A Tool for Analyzing Malware. In 15th Annual Conference of the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR), 2006.

		C. Kruegel, W. Robertson, and G. Vigna. Detecting KernelLevel Rootkits Through Binary Analysis. In Annual Computer Security Application Conference (ACSAC), 2004.
		\subsection{Chaitanya Palaka (1209261868)}
		To understand the topic of Malware Analysis better, I had chosen to read the paper 'Linux kernel-based feature selection for Android Malware Detection'. This paper discusses the automatic detection of malware on Android systems. Specifically, malware detection on Android was chosen because the platform is more vulnerable than others due to its open source nature. The authors of this paper use Machine Learning to achieve this, using a custom feature selection method and an SVM (support vector machine) classifier. The authors have composed a set of 59 features from the linux kernel from the subcategories of Memory, CPU and Network. These 'features' were taken from the linux /proc folder which holds system process information. The authors have then chosen to test their classifier with different set of features to test the accuracy. This was also due to the fact that previous research in this area used a far less number of features, and the authors were mainly considering the question : at what number of features does the classifier perform optimally? The results of their experiments were quite good, and optimal and correct classification of malware was found with 36 unique features.\\
		
		Going forward, i will research more about malware detection on linux systems. The papers i am considering reading and understanding are:

		\subsection{Varun Chandrasekar (1209248010)}
		Our team is working towards understanding various techniques that aid in malware analysis and detection. With respect to this have taken up the task of studying the research paper titled "Fileprint Analysis for Malware Detection".   The paper elucidates the various experiments the authors conducted to augment existing principles in malware detection and specifically talks about employing statistical binary content analysis to better single out the file segments that appear to be infected by malware. The experiments conducted included inserting malware at different locations and seeing how easily it is detected by the scanner with respect to the position it was injected in It also talks about analyzing binary content 1-gram distributions to classify infected files and also talks about using n-gram distance to distinguish self encrypted files from common executable files.\\
		
		Overall the paper gives a good understanding of the various pros and cons to the current malware detection techniques and discusses the results of experiments that were conducted to augment them. To further deepen my understanding, and collect as much relevant information on the topic as possible, I plan to go through the research papers listed below:
		
		1) Fileprints: Identifying File Types by n-gram Analysis
		Wei-Jen Li, Ke Wang, Salvatore J. Stolfo, Benjamin Herzog Columbia University
		2) MEF: Malicious Email Filter A UNIX Mail Filter that Detects Malicious Windows Executables Matthew Matthew G. Schultz and Eleazar Eskin, Erez Zadok, Manasi Bhattacharyya, and Salvatore J. Stolfo, Columbia University
		3) M. McDaniel, M. Heydari. “Content Based File Type Detection Algorithms”. 36 th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS’03).
		\subsection{Vimal Vadivelu (1209203043)}
		My work is to finding good research papers in the malware analysis field and helping people in finding them. In addition to it I was also reading a paper called “Identifying Dormant Functionality in Malware Programs” which proposes a new method in dynamic malware analysis. The paper talks about the disadvantages of the existing methods in the malware analysis and they propose a new idea called “REANIMATOR” for determining the malicious capabilities of malware programs. The main advantage of this “REANIMATOR” method is that it increases the number of ways that are dynamically explored than that of the traditional ones. The authors proved their idea by testing with IRC bots, packed bots. \\
		
		Overall the paper gives good understanding of dynamic malware analysis and its advantages and disadvantages. To further deepen my knowledge, the papers I am further considering are,
		Integrating Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis Using Machine Learning
		PyTrigger: A System to Trigger \& Extract User-Activated Malware Behavior
		A Testing Model for Dynamic Malware Analysis Systems
		
		\subsection{Kunal Bansal (1211213169)}
		\subsection{Raj Dalvi (1209232176)}
		My responsibility is to work with my team in ensuring the timely submissions of all deliverables. I also went through the paper “Siren: Catching Evasive Malware” and got more information on proactive Malware detection and techniques for preventing damage via new malware.\\
		The paper elaborates on a tool called Siren, an activity injection system which intends to fool malicious attackers by mocking human actions so the attacker will focus on them instead of the actual human actions. The traditional behavioral analysis is able to detect a lot of novel threats but they are always a step behind because they are reactive rather than proactive. Siren attempts to be more proactive against malware, specifically spyware.\\
		Secondly, the paper also admits that the tool has some weaknesses such as using an out-of-band channel to detect the mimicry of human activities. So, it is a well-rounded paper and provides a good perspective on proactive malware analysis.
		
		The researchers used virtual machines for their experiments. So, I will go into further detail on how they performed said experiments by going through the following papers:
		1) S. King and P. Chen. Subvirt: Implementing malware with virtual machines. In IEEE Symp. on Security and Privacy, Oakland, California, May 2006.
		2) W. Cheswick. An Evening with Berferd In Which a Hacker is Lured Endured and Studied. In Proc. of the Winter Usenix 92 Conference, 1992.
		3) K. Tan, K.S. Killourhy, and R.A. Maxion. Undermining an Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System Using Common Exploits.
